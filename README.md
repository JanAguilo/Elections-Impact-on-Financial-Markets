# Impact of U.S. Presidential Elections on Financial Markets

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election on financial markets by evaluating the performance of various sectors. To understand these effects, we will:

  1. Examine sector-specific performance around the 2024 election.
  2. Simulate hypothetical portfolios to assess potential investor outcomes.
  3. Conduct a historical comparison with the 2016 and 2020 elections to identify any recurring patterns or unique trends in market behavior.

By comparing sector reactions and portfolio outcomes, this project provides insights into how political events may influence financial markets and inform investment strategies during election cycles.

## Objectives

1. Analyze Sector Performance: Assess how sectors like Technology, Energy, and Finance reacted three days before and after each election.
2. Simulate Portfolios: Create hypothetical portfolios with diverse sector allocations and evaluate their short-term performance around election dates.
3. Historical Comparison: Identify any recurring patterns or differences in market behavior between 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections.
